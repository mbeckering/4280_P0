# 4280_P0
This is the base project for the semester-long development of a compiler.
The language and syntax are created by the instructor, and are relatively simple.
This initial project P0 processes command line arguments in main.
Invocation made with no arguments will take cin input.
Valid argument is one text file to be parsed.
The program separates strings from input or file into a binary search tree,
then prints preorder, inorder, and postorder.
